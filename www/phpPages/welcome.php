The SpatialExtremes package aims to provide tools for modeling spatial
extremes. Many environmetal processes are spatial by nature and the
knowledge of the univariate/multivariate distribution of extremes is
not enough. This package aims to fill this gap by using several
approaches. Currently, the modeling is performed through the
max-stable framework. Max-stable processes are the extension of the
extreme value theory to random fields. Later, different approaches
will be implemented such as the latent variable and the copula based
methodologies.

The development of the package has been financially supported by the
Competence Center Environment and Sustainability (CCES) and more
precisely within
the <a href="http://www.cces.ethz.ch/projects/hazri/EXTREMES">EXTREMES
    project</a>.
