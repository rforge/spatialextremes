      I'm currently a Maitre de Conference, which is more or less like a
      position of Assistant Professor in France, at the university
      of <a href="http://www.univ-montp2.fr">Montpellier II</a> within
      the
      <a href="http://ens.math.univ-montp2.fr/">Institute of Mathematics
	and Modelling</a>. However I start working on spatial extremes
      during a post-doctoral stay in Switzerland
      at <a href="http://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL</a> within
      the <a href="http://stat.epfl.ch/">Chair of Statistics</a> leaded
      by <a href="http://people.epfl.ch/Anthony.Davison">Prof. A. Davison</a>. During
      this post-doc period I was founded by
      the <a href="http://www.cces.ethz.ch/index">CCES</a>
      project <a href="http://www.cces.ethz.ch/projects/hazri/EXTREMES">EXTREMES</a>.
    </p>
    <p> My main intersts are (of course) extreme value theory but
      I'm also a Bayesian guy --- look at the latent variable approach
      of the SpatialExtreme package. <br /> You may want to have a look
      at my <a href="">web page</a>.

    <p>If you have any suggestions, comments or want to report a bug
      please do not hesitate to contact me.
