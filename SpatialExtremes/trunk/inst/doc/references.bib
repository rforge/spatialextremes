  abstract = {For likelihood-based inference involving distributions in which high-dimensional
	dependencies are present it may be useful to use approximate likelihoods
	based, for example, on the univariate or bivariate marginal distributions.
	The asymptotic properties of formal maximum likelihood estimators
	in such cases are outlined. In particular, applications in which
	only a single qx1 vector of observations is observed are examined.
	Conditions under which consistent estimators of parameters result
	from the approximate likelihood using only pairwise joint distributions
	are studied. Some examples are analysed in detail.},
