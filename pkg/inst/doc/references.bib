  abstract = {We use the properties of independence estimating equations to adjust
	the independence' loglikelihood function in the presence of clustering.
	The proposed adjustment relies on the robust sandwich estimator of
	the parameter covariance matrix, which is easily calculated. The
	methodology competes favourably with established techniques based
	on independence estimating equations; we provide some insight as
	to why this is so. The adjustment is applied to examples relating
	to the modelling of wind speed in Europe and annual maximum temperatures
	in the U.K.},

	Conditions under which consistent estimators of parameters result
	from the approximate likelihood using only pairwise joint distributions
