**************  Changes in SpatialExtremes Version 1.5-0  **************

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  ° The 'map' and 'condmap' functions now allow covariates

  ° fitmaxstab allows weights in the pairwise likelihood

  ° predict will display standard errors if possible

NEW FEATURES

  ° Brown-Resnick processes are available

  ° The generalized Cauchy correlation function is available

  ° New function 'lsmaxstab' that wraps 'fitcovariance' and 'fitcovmat'
    and is similar to 'fitmaxstab' but uses least squares

  ° Composite version of the BIC is available

  ° The standard errors are now computed without the use of the finite
    difference based estimate of the Hessian matrix

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

  ° The 'fitcovmat' and 'fitcovariance' will be removed soon as the
    new 'lsmaxstab' wraps them

BUG FIXES

  ° Fix a bug in simulating smith's max-stable process on a grid
