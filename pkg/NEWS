		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.5-1

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug in computing the standard errors for the geometric
    gaussian model (marginal part)


		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.5-0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	The 'map' and 'condmap' functions now allow covariates

    o	fitmaxstab allows weights in the pairwise likelihood

    o	predict will display standard errors if possible

NEW FEATURES

    o	Brown-Resnick processes are available

    o	The generalized Cauchy correlation function is available

    o	New function 'lsmaxstab' that wraps 'fitcovariance' and
    'fitcovmat' and is similar to 'fitmaxstab' but uses least squares

    o	Composite version of the BIC is available

    o	The standard errors are now computed without the use of the
    finite difference based estimate of the Hessian matrix

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

   o	The 'fitcovmat' and 'fitcovariance' will be removed soon as
   the new 'lsmaxstab' wraps them

BUG FIXES

    o	Fix a bug in simulating smith's max-stable process on a grid
