		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.6-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The extremal t model is now available --- including
    simulation. Simulations on a grid might be really long though.

    o Model checking for fitted max-stable processes is easier as a
    method for plotting object of class "maxstab" is implemented.

    o "fitspatgev" and "fitmaxstab" now allow for "temporal"
    covariates, for example a linear trend can be put for the location
    parameter.

NEW FEATURES

    o Simulation of Brown-Resnick processes are available but should
    *NOT* be considered as stable!

    o Computation of the empirical variogram is implemented

    o The fitting and simulation of max-stable processes is now much faster.

    o The circulant embedding method is now implemented.

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug when using temporal covariates.

    o Fix a bug in simulating Gaussian random fields having a powered
    exponential covariance function through the turning bands method.

    o The parametrization of Brown-Resnick processes was not
    consistent throughout the code. Now fixed.

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug in computing the standard errors for the geometric
    gaussian model (marginal part)


		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.5-0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	The 'map' and 'condmap' functions now allow covariates

    o	fitmaxstab allows weights in the pairwise likelihood

    o	predict will display standard errors if possible

NEW FEATURES

    o	Brown-Resnick processes are available

    o	The generalized Cauchy correlation function is available

    o	New function 'lsmaxstab' that wraps 'fitcovariance' and
    'fitcovmat' and is similar to 'fitmaxstab' but uses least squares

    o	Composite version of the BIC is available

    o	The standard errors are now computed without the use of the
    finite difference based estimate of the Hessian matrix

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

   o	The 'fitcovmat' and 'fitcovariance' will be removed soon as
   the new 'lsmaxstab' wraps them

BUG FIXES

    o	Fix a bug in simulating smith's max-stable process on a grid
